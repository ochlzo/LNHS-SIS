Built using:
  - React, javascript, And CSS for frontend.
  - Express.js and MySQL for the backend.

We haven't been able to migrate this project on a public domain yet.. But you can run it on your localhost using xampp.

How to run?
  - Create a folder, and store the 3 files from this folder.
  - Open xampp and start the Apache and MySqll servers
  - Create an empty database called "lnhs-sis"
  - In your code editor, open terminal and run these commands:
      - To run the backend:
          - cd backend
          - npm start
      - To run the frontend:
          - cd frontend
          - npm start

- I suggest running the backend first before the frontend
